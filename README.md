# PIE Mini-Project 1: Build Your Own Bike Light

## Part 1
In this mini-project you and your partner will build a bike light.  Your goal is to set up LEDs such that pressing a button will switch the system of lights between several different modes: all off, all flashing; all on; and “bouncing” lights (for example).  Your system should demonstrate a minimum of five modes and use at least three LEDs.

## Part 2
Use an analog input to modify the behavior of your bike light in an interesting way. One option is to use a potentiometer (an adjustable resistor). If you’re feeling adventurous, you can use the infrared distance sensor  Descargar infrared distance sensorthat you’ll use in mini-project 2 to, for example, have the light get brighter the closer an object is to the sensor using pulse width modulation (PWM) of the signal output on the digital pins. You could also change the speed at which the light flashes or “bounces.”
